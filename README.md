# Machine-Learning

This is a comprehensive Machine Learning project where I explore various concepts, techniques, and algorithms in ML, including data manipulation, preprocessing, classification, and regression.

## **Key Highlights:**

1. **Explored Numpy for Data Manipulation**  
   Learned and applied **Numpy** for efficient data handling, manipulation, and mathematical operations.

2. **Mastered Data Preprocessing Techniques**  
   Implemented various preprocessing steps to prepare data for machine learning models, including normalization, standardization, and handling missing values.

3. **Implemented Linear Regression & Logistic Regression**  
   Applied **Linear Regression** for regression tasks and **Logistic Regression** for classification tasks, helping to model relationships and predict outcomes.

4. **Built Classifiers: Decision Trees & K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   Developed classification models using **Decision Trees** and **K-Nearest Neighbors** algorithms, understanding their decision-making processes.

5. **Evaluated Models with Metrics for Regression & Classification**  
   Used various evaluation metrics, including **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression tasks and **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score** for classification tasks, to assess model performance.

6. **Explored Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
   Investigated the power of **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for classifying complex datasets with higher-dimensional features.

## **Project Overview**

The project aims to showcase different ML algorithms, from simple regression models to advanced classification techniques, by applying them to real-world datasets. By building and evaluating models such as **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, and SVM**, the goal was to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model and their suitability for different types of problems.
